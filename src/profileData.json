However, there are some things that will always be needed, always be necessary: Fulfilling the roles of the individual in order for the whole group to succeed: I have been the lead: making the calls and directing the action – I have been the troubleshooter: doing the groundwork and preparing the contingences – I have been the planner: conceptualizing, adapting, and realizing – I have been the backstop: filling-in, putting in the hours, and making sure completion is a functional reality. All require an adaptable, creative mind with strong communication skills and a solid work ethic."
